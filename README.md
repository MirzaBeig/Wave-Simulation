Simple (and blazing fast) wave simulation compute shader in Unity.

Works on mobile platforms that support compute (...most modern smartphones, for example).

## Compatibility

The project itself is URP, but AFAIK this should work with any pipeline.

- Tested with Unity 2022.3 (LTS). 
- Can be edited using Shader Graph.
